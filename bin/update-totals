# Oh god, this is awful. As someone else said quite frequently. :)
# 
# So updating cached_signers at the same time you confirm a
# signature is so slow as to collapse the whole site when it's
# busy, as we discovered today. So let's update cached_signers
# separately on cron. But you can't just do it in one update
# as the signer table somehow gets locked and given the number
# of writes going on there, that's just not allowed.
#
# Even just fetching the ids first and then updating with current
# live values does that sometimes. So let's just fetch some values
# and use them, even if by then they'll be out of date. It's not
# as if it's for anything important.
# 
# This currently takes around 2 minutes for the first query.
# And occasionally deadlocks, sigh.
