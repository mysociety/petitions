<h1><span dir="ltr">Terms and Conditions</span></h1>

<p>We aim to accept as many petitions as possible. The purpose of the
e-petition service is to enable as many people as possible to make
their views know. All petitions will be accepted and published on the
Downing Street website providing they meet the following criteria.</p>

<p>Petitions have long been sent to the Prime Minister by post, or
delivered to the Number 10 door in person. E-petitions are welcome in
the same way.</p>

<p>However, to protect this service from abuse, petitions must satisfy
some basic conditions.</p>

<p>To submit a petition, you must use the online form to provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>The title or subject of the petition;</li>
<li>a clear and concise statement covering the subject of the
petition. It should state what action the petitioner wishes the PM or
the Government to take. The petition will be returned to you to edit
if it is unclear what action is being asked for.</li>
<li>the petition author's contact address (in case we need to
contact you about the petition. This address is for our use only, and
will not be placed on the website);</li>
<li>the starting and closing date of the petition.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The information in a petition must be submitted in good faith. In
order for the for the petition service to comply with the law and with
the Civil Service Code, you must not include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Party political material. The Downing Street website is a
Government site. Party political content is not appropriate, under the
normal rules governing the Civil Service.  The Civil Service Code can
be viewed at <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/civilservicecode">www.civilservice.gov.uk/civilservicecode</a>.</li>
<li>false or defamatory statements;</li>
<li>information protected by an injunction or court order (for
example, the identities of children in custody disputes);</li>
<li>material which is commercially sensitive, confidential or which
may cause personal distress or loss;</li>
<li>the names of individual officials of public bodies, unless they
are part of the senior management of those organisations;</li>
<li>the names of family members of elected representatives or
officials of public bodies;</li>
<li>the names of individuals, or information where they may be
identified, in relation to criminal accusations;</li>
<li>offensive language, such as obvious swear words or language that
is intemperate, inflammatory, or provocative, or to which people
reading it could reasonably take offence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, to prevent spam problems, we reserve the right to reject:</p>
<ul>
<li>statements that don't actually request any action;</li>
<li>wording that is impossible to understand;</li>
<li>statements that are simply advertisements with no petition aim.</li>
</ul>

<p>Petitioners may freely disagree with the Government or call for
changes of policy. There will be no attempt to exclude critical views
and decisions will not be made on a party political basis.</p>

<p>Petitions that do not follow these guidelines cannot be accepted. In
these cases, you will be informed in writing of the reason(s) your
petition has been refused. If this happens, we will give you the
option of altering and resubmitting the petition so it can be
accepted.</p>

<p>If you decide not to resubmit your petition, or if the second
iteration is also rejected, we will list your petition and the
reason(s) for not accepting it on this website. We will publish the
full text of your petition, unless the content is illegal or offensive.
</p>

<p>
Once accepted, petitions will be made available on the Downing Street
website for anyone to sign.  Anyone signing the petition must provide
their name, address and a verifiable email address. No personal
details other than their name will be published on the site.
Information about any individual will not be used for any other
purpose than in relation to the petition, unless they choose to sign
up for other services offered on this website. You can read more on
this in our <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>.
</p>

<p>
It will usually take up to five working days from the time a petition
proposal is received for it to appear on the website. For more
information on the process, read our <a href="/steps">step-by-step guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
You petition will be available on this website until the specified
close date. If, however, during this time it becomes clear that your
petition is not being run in accordance with the terms, we reserve the
right to withdraw it. If this happens, we will contact you first to
allow you address the concerns we raise and we will only remove the
petition as a last resort.
