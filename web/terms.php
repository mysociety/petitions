<h1><span dir="ltr">Terms and Conditions</span></h1>

<p>The purpose of the
e-petition service is to enable as many people as possible to make
their views known. All petitions will be accepted and published on the
Downing Street website, providing they meet the criteria below.</p>

<p>Petitions have long been sent to the Prime Minister by post, or
delivered to the Number 10 door in person. E-petitions are welcome in
the same way.</p>

<p>Petitioners may freely disagree with the Government or call for
changes of policy. There will be no attempt to exclude critical views
and decisions to accept or reject will not be made on a party political basis.</p>

<p>However, to protect this service from abuse, petitions must satisfy
some basic conditions.</p>

<p>To submit a petition, you must use the online form to provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>the title or subject of the petition;</li>
<li>a clear and concise statement covering the subject of the
petition. It should state what action the petitioner wishes the PM or
the Government to take. The petition will be returned to you to edit
if it is unclear what action is being sought;</li>
<li>the petition author's contact address (in case we need to
contact you about the petition. This
will not be placed on the website);</li>
<li>a duration for the petition.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The information in a petition must be submitted in good faith. In
order for the petition service to comply with the law and with
the Civil Service Code, you must not include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Party political material. The Downing Street website is a
Government site. Party political content cannot be published, under the
<a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/civilservicecode">normal rules governing the Civil Service</a>.
Please note, this does not mean it is not permissible to petition on
controversial issues. For example, this party political petition
would not be permitted: "We petition the PM to change his party's policy on education",
but this non-party political version would be:
"We petition the PM to change the government's policy on education".</li>
<li>potentially libellous, false, or defamatory statements;</li>
<li>information which may be protected by an injunction or court order (for
example, the identities of children in custody disputes);</li>
<li>material which is potentially confidential, commercially sensitive, or which
may cause personal distress or loss;</li>
<li>any commercial endorsement, promotion of any product, service or publication;</li>
<li>URLs or web links (we cannot vet the content of external sites, and
therefore cannot link to them from this site);</li>
<li>the names of individual officials of public bodies, unless they
are part of the senior management of those organisations;</li>
<li>the names of family members of elected representatives or
officials of public bodies;</li>
<li>the names of individuals, or information where they may be
identified, in relation to criminal accusations;</li>
<li>language which is offensive, intemperate, or provocative. This not
only includes obvious swear words and insults, but any language to which
people reading it could reasonably take offence (we believe it is
possible to petition for anything, no matter how radical, politely).</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to reject:</p>
<ul>
<li>petitions that are similar to and/or overlap with an existing petition or petitions;</li>
<li>petitions which ask for things outside the remit or powers of the Prime Minister and Government;</li>
<li>statements that don't actually request any action;</li>
<li>wording that is impossible to understand;</li>
<li>statements that amount to advertisements;</li>
<li>petitions which are intended to be humorous, or which
have no point about government policy (however witty these
are, it is not appropriate to use a publicly-funded website
for purely frivolous purposes);</li>
<li>issues for which an e-petition is not the appropriate channel
(for example, correspondence about a personal issue);</li>
<li>Freedom of Information requests. This is not the right channel
for FOI requests; information about the appropriate procedure can be
found at <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/">http://www.ico.gov.uk/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Petitions that do not follow these guidelines cannot be accepted. In
these cases, you will be informed in writing of the reason(s) your
petition has been refused. If this happens, we will give you the
option of altering and resubmitting the petition so it can be
accepted.</p>

<p>If you decide not to resubmit your petition, or if the second
iteration is also rejected, we will list your petition and the
reason(s) for not accepting it on this website. We will publish the
full text of your petition, unless the content is illegal or offensive.
</p>

<p>
Once accepted, petitions will be made available on the Downing Street
website for anyone to sign.  Anyone signing the petition must provide
their name, address and a verifiable email address. No personal
details other than their name will be published on the site.
Information about any individual will not be used for any other
purpose than in relation to the petition, unless they choose to sign
up for other services offered on this website. You can read more on
this in our <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>.
</p>

<p>
It will usually take up to five working days from the time a petition
proposal is received for it to appear on the website. For more
information on the process, read our <a href="/steps">step-by-step guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
Your petition will be available on this website until the specified
closing date. If, however, during this time it becomes clear that your
petition is not being run in accordance with the terms, we reserve the
right to withdraw it. If this happens, we will contact you first to
allow you to address the concerns we raise and we will only remove the
petition as a last resort. 
</p>

<p>Please note that to keep the system manageable, and justify use of
resources, we can usually only respond to serious petitions of 200
signatures or more.</p>
