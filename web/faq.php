<h1><span dir="ltr">E-petitions Questions and Answers</span></h1>

<dl>
<dt>1. What is an e-petition?</dt>
<dd>
<p>An e-petition is a form of petition posted on a website. Individuals or groups can create a petition on the site and visitors can add their details to the petition to "sign" it. The format makes it easy to collect signatures, and it also makes it easier for us to respond directly using email.</p>
</dd>

<dt>2.	What's the difference between an e-petition and a paper petition?</dt>
<dd>
<p>There is no difference apart from the way in which the signatures are collected. A petition can gather names and addresses in either or both forms, though once someone has signed a petition in one format, they cannot sign it in another.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>3.	How do I start an e-petition?
<dd>
<p>
You can start a petition using our <a href="/new">e-petition form</a>. You will be asked to provide some basic information about yourself and your petition. We aim to make your petition live on the website within five working days.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>4.	Do you accept all petitions?</dt>

<dd>
<p>We aim to accept as many petitions as possible. However this site has to meet some basic conditions that are set out in our <a href="/acceptance">acceptance policy</a> and in the Civil Service Code.</p>

<p>Petitioners may freely disagree with the Government or call for changes of policy. There will be no attempt to exclude critical views and decisions will not be made on a party political basis.</p>
</dd>

<dt>5.	What happens if my petition is rejected?</dt>

<dd>
<p>If your petition does not meet these criteria, we will send it back to you along with an explanation of the reason(s) for rejection. We will give you the option of altering and resubmitting the petition.</p>

<p>If you decide not to resubmit your petition, or if your second iteration is also rejected, we record list your petition and the reason(s) for not accepting it on this website.</p>
</dd>

<dt>6.	Can I still send in a paper petition?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
Yes. Paper petitions can still be posted/delivered to Downing Street in the way that they always have been. If you would prefer to collect signatures on paper, you should send them to:
</p>
<p>
10 Downing Street
London SW1A 2AA
</p>
</dd>

<dt>7.	How long will my petition run for?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
You can decide how long your petition can run for and we will carry it for up to 12 months.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>8.	What will happen to my petition once it is finished?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Once your petition has closed it will be passed to officials who work for the Prime Minister in Downing Street, or sent to the relevant Government department for a response.</p>

<p>Every person who signs a petition via this website will receive an email detailing the Government's response to the issues raised.</p>
</dd>

<dt>9.	How do I sign a petition?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
To sign a petition, you will need to give your name, address and email on the form provided. Once you have signed the petition, you will receive an email asking you to confirm that you wish to add your name to the petition by clicking a link. Once you have done this, your name will be added to the petition. Unless you ask us not to, your name (but no other personal details) will be displayed on the petition on the website.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>10.	What will you do with my name and address details if I sign a petition?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
Nothing, unless you expressly ask to sign up for other services available on the Downing Street website (eg email updates). We will use your email address to confirm your signature and, unless you ask us not to, we will also send you a response to the issues raised in the petition. See our <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a> for more information.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>11.	Who are mySociety and what is their involvement in the e-petition service?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
mySociety is a charitable project that builds websites which give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. It is strictly neutral on party political issues, and is run by registered charity UKCOD (no. 1076346). mySociety's role was in designing and building the petitioning software to be as easy to use, as transparent and as trustworthy as possible.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>12.	Why have you set up this service?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
We are offering this service to enable as many people as possible to make their views known to the Government. The service will enable smaller groups who may not have the funds to set up a website to still collect signatures online. It also will enable us to respond directly to those who have signed the petition online via email.
