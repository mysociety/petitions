<ul>
<li>The title or subject of the petition. </li>
<li>A clear and concise statement covering the subject of the petition. </li>

<h4>What is not allowed?</h4>

<ul>

<li>It does not follow the guidelines set out above.</li>
<li>It refers to a development plan, or specific planning matter, including planning applicants.</li>

</ul>

<p>The information in a petition must be submitted in good faith. For the petition service to comply with the law, you must not include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Party political material. This does not mean it is not permissible to petition on controversial issues. For example, this party political petition would not be permitted: &quot;we petition the council to change the conservative administration's policy on housing&quot;, but this non-party political version would be: &quot;we petition the council to change its policy on housing&quot;. </li>
<li>Potentially libellous, false, or defamatory statements. </li>
<li>Information which may be protected by an injunction or court order (for example, the identities of children in custody disputes).</li>
<li>Material which is potentially confidential, commercially sensitive, or which may cause personal distress or loss.</li>
<li>Any commercial endorsement, promotion of any product, service or publication.</li>
<li>The names of individual officials of public bodies, unless they are part of the senior management of those organisations.</li>

<h4>Why might we reject your petition?</h4>
<p>Petitions which do not follow the guidelines above cannot be accepted. In these cases, you will be informed in writing of the reason(s) your petition has been refused. If this happens, we will give you the option of altering and resubmitting the petition so it can be accepted.</p>
<p>If you decide not to resubmit your petition, or if the second one is also rejected, we will list your petition and the reason(s) for not accepting it on this website. We will publish the full text of your petition, unless the content is illegal or offensive. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to reject: </p>

<ul>
<li>Petitions similar to and/or overlap with an existing petition or petitions.</li>
<li>Petitions which ask for things outside the remit or powers of the council. </li>
<li>Statements that don't request any action. We cannot accept petitions which call upon the council to &quot;recognise&quot; or &quot;acknowledge&quot; something, as they do not call for a recognisable action. </li>
<li>Wording that needs amending, or is impossible to understand. Please don't use capital letters excessively as they can make petitions hard to read. </li>
<li>Statements that amount to advertisements.</li>
<li>Petitions intended to be humorous, or which have no point about council policy.</li>

<h3>Common causes for rejection</h3>

<p>Running the petition site, we see a lot of people having petitions
rejected for a handful of very similar reasons. In order to help you
avoid common problems, we've produced this list:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don't accept petitions on individual legal cases such as
deportations because we can never ascertain whether the individual
involved has given permission for their details to be made publicly
known. We advise petitioners to take their concerns on such matters
directly to the Home Office.</li>

<li>Please don't use 'shouting' capital letters excessively as they
can make petitions fall foul of our 'impossible to read' criteria.</li>

<li>We receive a lot of petitions on devolved matters. If your
petition relates to the powers devolved to parts of the UK, such as
the Welsh Assembly or Scottish Parliament, you should approach those
bodies directly as these things are outside the remit of the Prime
Minister. This also applies to matters relating to London, such as
the Underground, which should be directed to the Greater London
Assembly and the Mayor's Office.</li>

<li>We also receive petitions about decisions that are clearly private
sector decisions, such as whether to re-introduce a brand of breakfast
cereal. These are also outside the remit of the Prime Minister.</li>

<li>We cannot accept petitions which call upon <?=OPTION_SITE_PETITIONED?> to "recognise" or
"acknowledge" something, as they do not clearly call for a
recognisable action.</li>
