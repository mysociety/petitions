<h3>General questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt>What is an e-petition?</dt>
<dd>
<p>An e-petition is a form of petition posted on a website. Individuals or groups can create a petition on the site and visitors can add their details to the petition to "sign" it. The format makes it easy to collect signatures, and it also makes it easier for us to respond directly using email.</p>
</dd>

<dt>What's the difference between an e-petition and a paper petition?</dt>
<dd>
<p>There is no theoretical difference, only the way in which the signatures are collected and delivered. A petition can gather names and addresses in either or both forms, though once someone has signed a petition in one format, they cannot sign it in another.

<h3>Petition signing questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt>How do I sign a petition?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
To sign a petition, you will need to give your name, address and email on the form provided. Once you have signed the petition, you will receive an email asking you to confirm that you wish to add your name to the petition by clicking a link. Once you have done this, your name will be added to the petition.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>What will you do with my name and address details if I sign a petition?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
We will use your email address
to confirm your signature and, unless you ask us not to, we will also send you
a maximum of two responses to the issues raised in the petition. In the future
we may introduce a facility to enable the creator of the petition to send you a
maximum of two emails as well.  See our <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>
for more information. The data themselves are held by mySociety and not by the
council or any other government bodies or agencies.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>I share an email address with other people &mdash; can we all sign the petition?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
No. Due to the possibility of fake signatures being added if we let people
using one address sign in multiple times, we only allow one signature per email
account.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Why not "sign against" petitions?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
<p>We thought carefully about allowing this, but decided against it. E-petitions
are designed to be a modern version of the traditional paper petitions
presented to the council. They are a way of allowing people to put their views
to the council, not a form of referendum or opinion poll, which is what they
would become if we allowed the "sign against" option. (Professional opinion
polls use special techniques to ensure balanced samples, which is something
e-petitions can't do).</p>

<p>If you disagree with a particular petition your best option is to create a
counter-petition to an existing campaign. Many people have already done this.</p>

<h3>Petition creation questions</h3>

<dl>

<dt>How do I start an e-petition?
<dd>
<p>
You can start a petition using our <a href="/new">e-petition form</a>. You will be asked to provide some basic information about yourself and your petition. We aim to make your petition live on the website within five working days, although during busy periods it may take longer.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Do you accept all petitions?</dt>

<dd>
<p>We aim to accept as many petitions as possible. However please see our
<a href="/terms">terms and conditions</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Petitioners may freely disagree with the council or call for changes of
policy. There will be no attempt to exclude critical views and decisions to
accept or reject will not be made on a party political basis.</p>
</dd>

<dt>What happens if my petition is rejected?</dt>

<dd>
<p>If your petition does not meet these criteria, we will send it back to you along with an explanation of the reason(s) for rejection. We will give you the option of altering and resubmitting the petition.</p>

<p>If you decide not to resubmit your petition, or if your second one is also
rejected, we will list your petition and the reason(s) for not accepting it on
this website.</p>
</dd>

<dt>How long will my petition run for?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
You can decide how long your petition can run for and we will carry it for up to 12 months.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>What will happen to my petition once it is finished?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Once your petition has closed, usually provided there are <?=cobrand_signature_threshold() ?> signatures or more, it
will be passed to the relevant officials at the council for a response.</p>

<p>Every person who signs such a petition will receive an email detailing the
response to the issues raised.</p>
</dd>

<h3>Organisational questions</h3>

<dt>Who are mySociety and what is their involvement in the e-petition service?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
mySociety (registered charity no. 1076346) builds websites which give people simple, tangible
benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. It is strictly neutral on party
political issues. mySociety's role was in designing and building the petitioning software
to be as easy to use, as transparent and as trustworthy as possible.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Why have you set up this service?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
We are offering this service to enable as many people as possible to make their
views known to the council. The service will enable smaller groups who may not
have the funds to set up a website to still collect signatures online. It also
will enable us to respond directly to those who have signed the petition online
via email.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Can I make my own petitions site?</dt>

<dd>Yes, the software behind this petitions site is open source, and
available to you under the GNU Affero GPL software license. You can
<a
href="http://github.com/mysociety/petitions">download the source code</a>
and help us develop it. You're welcome to use
it in your own projects, although you must also make available
the source code to any such projects.
